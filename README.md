**GentWriter** is an AI-powered agent designed to automatically generate various social media content based on an input article URL.

It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) via the [Google AI SDK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) to create tailored posts for different platforms.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Article Fetching:** Retrieves the content and title of an article from a given URL.
* **SEO Meta Description Generation:** Creates concise, keyword-focused meta descriptions suitable for search engines.
* **X.com (Twitter) Post Generation:** Crafts short, engaging tweets summarizing the article, including relevant hashtags and the article link.
* **LinkedIn Post Generation:** Generates professional LinkedIn posts highlighting key insights from the article, tailored for a professional audience, and includes the article link.
* **Modular Agent Design:** Built using the `google-adk` framework, organizing different functionalities into distinct agents (retrieval, SEO, X, LinkedIn) managed by a sequential workflow.
* **Configurable:** Allows setting the underlying LLM model via environment variables.
